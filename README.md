# 2018 FIRST Robotics Power Up Competition
Team 6493 Red Steel's 2018 code for PATRICIA.

Written in Java, implementing WPILib's control system.


# Packages
Our code this year implements two main packages, the robot package, and one contained within, subsystems.

## Robot
The robot package contains the main robot class, as well as a class containing button mappings for most, if not all, robot functions.

## Subsystems
Contains the classes for the drivetrain, intake arms, and arm elevator for the robot. Refers to the RobotMap class for CAN channels and button mappings.
